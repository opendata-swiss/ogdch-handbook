"For the :ref:`JavaScript widget <embed-widget>` solution described above,"

"*opendata.swiss* roadmap there will be support for requesting DCAT-AP "

"Note that performance issues could potentially be compounded by "

"We investigated the possibility of supporting publishers of 'static "
"sites', such as this handbook. The deployment of rich content could be "
"extended with dynamic crawling and updating of content during the "
"publication process without reliance on cross-site requests in the "
"browser. This would however require technical effort for the specific "
"publishing platforms, and come with the synchronicitiy issues of the "
"Cards option - i.e. the embedded information will only be as recent as "

"Access to regular exports from the portal's underlying database - in "

"Access to the metadata of the portal itself would be a sound option for "

"of the API, could be another strategy to pursue in the future."
