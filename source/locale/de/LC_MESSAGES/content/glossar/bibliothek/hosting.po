"Das Hosting von Daten ist Grundvoraussetzung, um OGD auf opendata.swiss "
"zu veröffentlichen. Die Verantwortung dafür liegt bei den "
"Datenpublizierenden selbst. Hier sind die wichtigsten Fragen und "
"Antworten rund um das Thema Daten Hosting zusammengefasst. Die Fragen und"
" Antworten sind derzeit nur in Englisch verfügbar."

"In order for you to import data to the opendata.swiss catalog, the data "
"must be freely accessible somewhere. Only the metadata and a link to the "
"data are published on opendata.swiss. Responsibility for actual data "
"hosting lies with the data supplier."

"Data hosting is now relatively cheap and simple to manage, even if you do"
" not yet have a solution in place within your organization. However, "
"there are some issues you should consider before publication:"

msgid "Cloud vs. data center?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/content/glossar/bibliothek/hosting.rst:36
msgid ""
"Here we refer to the way your content is serviced on the Internet. In a "
"data center, your organization would typically be responsible for running"
" a \"full stack\", or entire collection, of applications required for web"
" hosting. This means providing support for DNS, HTTP, SMTP and other "
"critical protocols using specialized \"server\" programs. You often have "
"the ability to decide on each of these components and pick the best "
"combination. In a cloud environment, there is sometimes considerably less"
" flexibility, however by centralizing administration and maintenance, the"
" overall costs per site can be much lower."

msgid ""
"Preparing for disasters, and ensuring that data does not get lost during "
"updates or changes, are extremely important tasks in setting up for long-"
"term hosting. Ensure that you know how to get duplicates of your data, "
"which are ideally being versioned for selective restoration, find out how"
" much time and effort this process takes - and test it in advance, to be "
"calm and prepared for any eventuality."

msgid ""
"As every smartphone user knows, access to data comes at a cost. Whether "
"it is uploading large datasets, or potentially being restricted from "
"sharing your data to a large number of users, check with your hosting "
"provider on what are the financial and technical aspects of this "
"question. For instance, some providers can put special measures in place "
"to \"scale up\" the rate at which your content is being distributed ahead"
" of a marketing campaign or publicity - ensuring that none of your "
"visitors get to see error messages or outages."

#: ../../source/content/glossar/bibliothek/hosting.rst:73
msgid ""
"Redundancy is the concept of having alternative copies of the same "
"information. In the case of web hosting, this often means having multiple"
" servers in multiple locations provisioning the exact same content. This "
"is useful for maximing performance across the world, or having a \"safe "
"failover\" - in case one of the copies (for example, of an e-commerce web"
" site) is for some reason inaccessible, one of the others "
"immediately/automatically take over, and no business is lost."
