"The World Wide Web has radically altered the way we share knowledge, by "

"In summary, Linked Data is about publishing data on top of the Web, and "
"promoting links between data from different sources, through production "
"of human- and machine-readable documents. Linked Data is a term used to "
"describe a set of recommended best practices for exposing, sharing, and "
"connecting pieces of data, information, and knowledge on the Web’s "
"HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), using Universal Resource Identifier "

"get information about that resource. For a user, it means that by "
"clicking on a URL - e.g. ``http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland`` - "

"RDF is a data model where each piece of information is a simple sentence "

"Linked Data is shareable, extensible, and easily re-usable. It supports "

"labeling of concepts identified by URIs. By using globally unique "
